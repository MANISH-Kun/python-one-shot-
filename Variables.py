What are variables?
A variable is like a labeled box where you can store information. You give it a name and put a value inside. Later, you can use that name to get the value back.
In real life:
Your name is a “variable” that stores what people call you
Your age is a “variable” that stores a number
Your favorite color is a “variable” that stores text
In Python, we create variables to store data our programs need to remember.

name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_student = True
